This repository holds codes and presentation for workshop done by dataclair.ai during the Machine Learning Prague 2024 conference. The workshop presented how to automatically evaluate performance of RAG app using knowledgebase from wikipedia about several elections around the world from 2022 to 2024. You can find the RAG app together with instructions on what to do in the `rag-app.ipynb` jupyter notebook. The accompanying presentation is in the `presentation` folder. For people interested in creating their own knowledgebase or want to use different embedding model, we are also including the scraped data together with `prepare-data.ipynb` notebook for creating the Chroma db.
