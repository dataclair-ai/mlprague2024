Presidential elections <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Turkish_presidential_elections> were held in Turkey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey> in May 2023, alongside parliamentary
elections <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2023_Turkish_parliamentary_election>, to elect a president <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey> for a term of five years.^[1]
<#cite_note-2> Dubbed the most important election of 2023,^[2]
<#cite_note-3> ^[3] <#cite_note-4> the presidential election went to a
run-off <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system> for the first
time in Turkish history.^[4] <#cite_note-aj-5> The election had
originally been scheduled to take place on 18 June, but the government
moved them forward by a month to avoid coinciding with the university
exams, the Hajj pilgrimage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj> and the
start of the summer holidays <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Summer_vacation>.^[5] <#cite_note-6> It is estimated that a total of
64 million voters had the right to cast their votes in elections,
60.9 million in Turkey and 3.2 million abroad.^[6] <#cite_note-7>

Incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan> of the Justice and Development Party
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)>
(AK Party) ran for re-election as the joint candidate of the People's
Alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Alliance_(Turkey)>,
which includes the Nationalist Movement Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Nationalist_Movement_Party> (MHP) and two other smaller parties.
The Nation Alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nation_Alliance_(Turkey)>, composed of six opposition parties <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Six> including the main opposition
Republican People's Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Republican_People%27s_Party> (CHP), fielded CHP leader Kemal
Kılıçdaroğlu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kemal_K%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7daro%C4%9Flu> as its presidential candidate.
Though not part of the alliance, the pro-Kurdish Party of Greens and the
Left Future <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Party_of_Greens_and_the_Left_Future> (YSGP) and the Labour and Freedom
Alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_and_Freedom_Alliance> (of
which it is a member) endorsed Kılıçdaroğlu.^[7] <#cite_note-8> Two
other minor candidates, namely Homeland Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Homeland_Party_(Turkey,_2021)> leader Muharrem İnce <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muharrem_%C4%B0nce> and anti-immigration <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-immigration> ultranationalist Ancestral
Alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Alliance> nominee
Sinan Oğan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinan_O%C4%9Fan>, also reached
the required 100,000 signatures to stand; however, three days before the
election, İnce withdrew from the election citing consistent slander and
smear campaigns against him by rival candidates, though he still
appeared on ballots.^[8] <#cite_note-Ince_withdrawal-9>

The main campaign issues revolved around the deadly February 2023
Turkey–Syria earthquake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake>, which left over 50,000 people
dead and threatened to postpone the election date.^[9] <#cite_note-10>
^[10] <#cite_note-11> The government was criticised^[/by whom? <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/
Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions>/] for its slow response to the
earthquake and land amnesties prior to it that critics claimed left
buildings more vulnerable.^[11] <#cite_note-12> The economy <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_economy> also featured prominently due to
the rapidly rising cost of living <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cost_of_living>. In most polls, voters identified the economy as their
prime area of concern.^[12] <#cite_note-13>

In the first round Erdoğan and Oğan outperformed expectations to receive
49.5% and 5.2% of the vote respectively, while Kılıçdaroğlu received
44.9% and Muharrem İnce (who remained on the ballot despite withdrawing)
0.4%. As Erdoğan's vote share was 0.5% short of winning outright, he and
Kılıçdaroğlu contested a run-off vote on 28 May. Oğan endorsed Erdoğan,
while the elements of Ancestral Alliance split their support, as Victory
Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Party_(Turkey)> leader Ümit
Özdağ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cmit_%C3%96zda%C4%9F> endorsed
Kılıçdaroğlu and My Country Party leader Neşet Doğan endorsed
Erdoğan.^[13] <#cite_note-14> ^[14] <#cite_note-15> Erdoğan went on to
win with 52% of the vote.


    Background[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

      2018 elections[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=2>]

The previous Turkish general election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2018_Turkish_presidential_election> took place on 24 June 2018. The
election marked the country's transition from a parliamentary system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentarism> to a presidential one
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system>, as narrowly
endorsed by voters in the controversial 2017 constitutional referendum
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum>.^[15] <#cite_note-16> ^[16]
<#cite_note-17> That election resulted in a victory for incumbent
president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan>, who had held the position since 2014.^[17]
<#cite_note-18> Meanwhile, the ruling Justice and Development Party
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)>
(AKP) lost its absolute majority in the Grand National Assembly of
Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey>
for the first time since June 2015 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
June_2015_Turkish_general_election>, forcing it to rely on its coalition
partner, the Nationalist Movement Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nationalist_Movement_Party> (MHP) of Devlet Bahçeli <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devlet_Bah%C3%A7eli>, to pass legislation.^[18]
<#cite_note-19>


    Date[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=3>]

The regular scheduled date for the first round of the elections was set
for 18 June 2023. However, the electoral system allowed for moving the
date forward. In 2020, there was speculation about a snap election prior
to the regular one in 2023. At the time, Devlet Bahçeli <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devlet_Bah%C3%A7eli>, the leader of coalition
partner MHP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Movement_Party>,
ruled them out. In a written statement, he said that elections would not
be held before 2023. He also confirmed that the current coalition
between AKP and MHP will remain intact and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan> will be their
joint nominee for President <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2023_Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan_presidential_campaign>.^[19] <#cite_note-20>


      Discussion on snap elections[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=4>]

In early January 2023 the AKP mentioned eventual snap elections to take
place on either on 16 or 30 April or on 14 May.^[20] <#cite_note-:02-21>
But the so called "Table of Six <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Table_of_Six>" composed by six opposition parties announced that they
would not agree to snap elections after 6 April.^[20] <#cite_note-:
02-21> On 18 January 2023, Erdoğan, the President of Turkey, signalled
that the elections will be held earlier than the scheduled date,
specifically on 14 May 2023, in a symbolic reference to the election
victory of former Prime Minister Adnan Menderes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Menderes> on 14 May in the 1950 Turkish
general election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
1950_Turkish_general_election>, defeating the candidate of the then
governing CHP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Republican_People%27s_Party> party.^[21] <#cite_note-22> On 22 January
2023, Erdoğan stated that the elections will be held on 14 May. In view
of that date, the "Table of Six" announced that Erdoğan cannot run for
president without parliamentary consent.^[22] <#cite_note-:16-23>


      Discussion on postponing election date[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=5>]

After a devastating earthquake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake> struck the country in February
2023, Erdoğan announced a state of emergency for 10 affected provinces
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Turkey>, which would end a
week ahead of the election date of the 14 May.^[23] <#cite_note-24> The
opposition voted against the imposition in parliament.^[24]
<#cite_note-:2-25> Then on 13 February 2023, Bülent Arınç <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BClent_Ar%C4%B1n%C3%A7>, a former AKP Member
of Parliament, alleged the elections could not be held in the current
situation in either May or June, and the elections should be
postponed.^[24] <#cite_note-:2-25> AKP spokesperson Ömer Çelik <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96mer_%C3%87elik> responded that Arınç's
statement is his own personal view and does not bind the party.^[25]
<#cite_note-26> Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kemal_K%C4%B1l%C4%B1%C3%A7daro%C4%9Flu> from the opposition party
Republican People's Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Republican_People%27s_Party> (CHP) responded to Arınç's statement that
the constitution would not provide a possibility to postpone the
elections except in the case of war.^[24] <#cite_note-:2-25> Further,
Mustafa Tolga Öztürk from the Good Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Good_Party> reasoned only the parliament has the authority to postpone
elections and Selahattin Demirtaş <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Selahattin_Demirta%C5%9F> from the Peoples' Democratic Party <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)> (HDP)
suspected such a measure would result in a political coup.^[24]
<#cite_note-:2-25>

    Electoral system[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=7>]

The President of Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
President_of_Turkey> is directly elected through the two-round system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system>, under which a
candidate must obtain a simple majority <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Majority> (more than 50%) of the popular vote to be elected. If no
candidate secures an overall majority outright, then a runoff is held
between the two most voted-for candidates from the first round, the
winner of which is then declared elected. The first direct election to
the Turkish presidency was held in 2014, after a referendum in 2007
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Turkish_constitutional_referendum>
abolished the previous system under which the head of state was elected
by the legislature chamber, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey>. The
President of Turkey is subject to term limits, and may serve at most two
five-year terms.^[27] <#cite_note-28> If snap elections were held before
the end of the second term, a third term would be permitted.^[28]
<#cite_note-29> ^[29] <#cite_note-:1-30> Snap elections can be held
either with the consent of 60% of the MPs in the Grand National Assembly
of Turkey or ordered by presidential decree. Only snap elections via the
consent of the Grand National Assembly during a president's second term
can allow the president to serve a third term.^[30] <#cite_note-31>

Prospective presidential candidates must be at least 40 years old and
must have completed higher education. Any political party that has won
5% of the vote in the previous parliamentary election can put forward a
candidate, although parties that have not met this threshold can form
alliances and field joint candidates as long as their total vote share
exceeds 5%. Independents <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Independent_(politician)> can run if they collect 100,000 signatures
from the electorate.^[31] <#cite_note-32> Elections are overseen by the
Supreme Election Council <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Supreme_Election_Council_(Turkey)> (YSK).^[32] <#cite_note-:3-33>

      Nominations[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=10>]

According to article 101 of the Constitution of Turkey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Turkey>, amended following the
2017 constitutional referendum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum>, any political party that has
won 5% of the vote in the previous parliamentary election can put
forward a candidate. The remaining candidates were required to collect
at least 100,000 signatures.^[42] <#cite_note-ntv-45>

Voters were able to give signatures to their preferred presidential
candidate between 22 and 27 March at their local electoral council
branch.^[42] <#cite_note-ntv-45>

On 24 March, the New Welfare Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Ballot paper (2nd round)

The first round of elections showed a shift further to the nationalist
sentiment.^[88] <#cite_note-jpost-92>


      Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=14>]

Oğan said that "Turkish nationalists <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Turkish_nationalism> and Atatürk supporters <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Kemalism> will be the decision-makers in the second round".^[89]
<#cite_note-93> Oğan demanded that he doesn't want any party, that he
considers connected to terrorism, to have any role in the
government.^[90] <#cite_note-:10-94> He is against the presence of a
Kurdish party in the "political equation".^[91] <#cite_note-:18-95> He
mentioned two parties specifically: HÜDA PAR <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Free_Cause_Party>, a Kurdish Islamist party allied with Erdoğan,
and the pro-Kurdish HDP, which supported Kılıçdaroğlu.^[90]
<#cite_note-:10-94> ^[91] <#cite_note-:18-95> If Kılıçdaroğlu signed a
protocol he would not make concessions to the HDP, he could receive
Oğan's support.^[91] <#cite_note-:18-95> On 19 May, Kılıçdaroğlu visited
the headquarters of the Victory Party and met with its leader
Özdağ.^[92] <#cite_note-96> The same day, Oğan met Erdoğan for
negotiations,^[93] <#cite_note-97> while Erdoğan told CNN International
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_International> he "would not bow to
Oğan's wishes", adding he's "not the kind of person who likes to bargain
like this".^[94] <#cite_note-98> Bahçeli published a message on the
occasion of the Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Commemoration_of_Atat%C3%BCrk,_Youth_and_Sports_Day>; alluding to Oğan,
he said "those who pretend to have non-existent political power and turn
politics into a horse market are opportunistic weaklings".^[95]
<#cite_note-99> On 22 May, AKP deputy chairman Numan Kurtulmuş <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numan_Kurtulmu%C5%9F> visited Özdağ at Victory
Party headquarters, where he stated that they shared similar ideas with
the Victory Party on various issues such as national security and noted
they hoped the party would support Erdogan in the second round.^[96]
<#cite_note-100> The same day, Özdağ and Kılıçdaroğlu came together for
the second time. During the meeting, Özdağ presented a memorandum of
understanding to Kılıçdaroğlu.^[97] <#cite_note-101> Özdağ's main terms
included "continuation of the trustee practice for the fight against
terrorism" and "forcibly returning the immigrants within a year if
necessary". He also said that they're "still trying to close the gates
of hell", referring to Oğan's old quote.^[98] <#cite_note-102>


        Dissolution of ATA Alliance[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?
        title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=15>]

On 21 May, it was announced that Kılıçdaroğlu would visit the Justice
Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Party_(Turkey,_2015)>
headquarters on 22 May. The same day, its leader Vecdet Öz announced his
support of Kılıçdaroğlu, saying "it is essential to get rid of the
current government", and adding that "staying neutral means giving
indirect support to the current government".^[99] <#cite_note-103>
Later, Öz announced that the alliance has officially ended.^[100]
<#cite_note-104>


        Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?
        title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=16>]

On 22 May, Oğan announced his endorsement of Erdoğan for the second
round,^[101] <#cite_note-105> while Özdağ stated that Oğan's statement
doesn't bind the Victory Party.^[102] <#cite_note-106> Later Erdoğan
thanked Oğan, and added that there was "absolutely no bargaining"
between them.^[103] <#cite_note-107>


        Özdağ's support for Kılıçdaroğlu[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/
        w/index.php?
        title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=17>]

On 24 May, Özdağ announced his support for Kılıçdaroğlu. They signed a
seven-point protocol, which reads as follows:^[104] <#cite_note-duvar-108>

  * The first four articles of our Constitution and the definition and
    content of Turkish Citizenship in Article 66 will be preserved.
  * The national-unitary-secular state established in 1924 will never be
    compromised.
  * All asylum seekers and fugitives, especially Syrians, will be sent
    back to their countries within one year at the latest.
  * All terrorist organizations targeting the existence and integrity of
    the state, especially FETÖ, PKK and ISIS, will be fought effectively
    and decisively. Within the framework of the fight against terrorism,
    the practice of appointing state officials instead of local
    administrators whose links with terrorism are proven by legal
    evidence will continue within the framework of judicial decision.
  * Terrorism will be fought, not negotiated. No political and legal
    arrangements targeting the national and unitary state structure of
    Turkey will be allowed.
  * In assignments to be made in all units of the state, it will be
    ensured that merit, not loyalty, is the basis.
  * All corruption will be dealt with very effectively within the
    framework of the law.
  * It is fully agreed that the state should be transparent and open to
    its citizens.

The fourth article in the protocol, created some concerns especially
among HDP voter base and raised the question of whether they will
boycott the election.^[104] <#cite_note-duvar-108> Next day,
nevertheless, HDP and Green Left Party have announced that they will
continue to support Kılıçdaroğlu in the second round, and said they
"will change the one-man regime".^[105] <#cite_note-109> HDP co-chair
Pervin Buldan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervin_Buldan> said "We
never get stuck with Ümit Özdağ's racist and fascist statements. The
main thing for us is the promises made by Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu to the
society."^[106] <#cite_note-110>

The Good Party leader Meral Akşener <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Meral_Ak%C5%9Fener> said "there is nothing in that protocol that bothers
us".^[104] <#cite_note-duvar-108>


      Erdoğan's strategy[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=18>]

He was scheduled to meet with the victims of recent earthquakes to show
his solidarity and commitment.^[107] <#cite_note-111> ^[/needs update

      Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=19>]

According to journalist İsmail Saymaz, Kılıçdaroğlu was going to adopt a
more aggressive language until 28 May and the AK Party would be attacked
over the relationship between HÜDA PAR and Hezbollah. A counter stance
would be taken regarding terrorism and security policies. The issue of
Syrians and illegal immigrants would be highlighted.^[108]

      Potential debate[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=20>]

Due to the accusations of who was a supporter of terrorists, which both
contenders deem the other to be, Kılıçdaroğlu suggested holding a
debate, but Erdoğan refused on the grounds that Kılıçdaroğlu wants to
become famous.^[110] <#cite_note-114>

      Erdoğan's right to seek re-election[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=22>]

Before the 2018 elections, Turkish presidents were serving as heads of
state <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state> within a
parliamentary system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Parliamentary_system>. After the 2017 constitutional referendum
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum>,
Turkey adopted a presidential system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Presidential_system> in which the president serves as the head of
government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government>. Some
opposition politicians state that since Erdoğan was elected president
twice in 2014 and 2018, he cannot be a candidate again unless an early
election is called by the Parliament, as stated in Article 116 of the
constitution.^[22] <#cite_note-:16-23> Some jurists argue that since the
presidential system was introduced in 2018 and a new office was formed
apart from the similarity in name, the 2018 election was Erdoğan's first
term in the new system and that he has the right to be a candidate
again.^[111] <#cite_note-115> ^[112] <#cite_note-:0-116>


      Political violence[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=23>]

On 10 March, CHP parliamentary group deputy chair Özgür Özel <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96zg%C3%BCr_%C3%96zel> claimed that
Kılıçdaroğlu received assassination threats by unknown groups^[/
clarification needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Please_clarify>/] and was offered a minister's armoured
vehicle by the government, but he rejected the proposal and kept his
official car.^[113] <#cite_note-117>

On 7 May, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ekrem_%C4%B0mamo%C4%9Flu> was attacked during a rally in Erzurum
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzurum>. His rally was interrupted due
to stones thrown from the crowd.^[114] <#cite_note-118> After the
attack, İmamoğlu supporters rushed to the Sabiha Gökçen Airport
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabiha_G%C3%B6k%C3%A7en_Airport> in
Istanbul to welcome and show support for him.^[115] <#cite_note-119>
Erzurum's mayor Mehmet Sekmen said that there was no written application
made from Republican People's Party's provincial chairmanship to hold a
rally in Erzurum, and it was İmamoğlu "was the one who created the chaos
by rallying in Erzurum".^[116] <#cite_note-120> The Interior Minister
Süleyman Soylu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCleyman_Soylu> said
that the incident was planned by İmamoğlu to aggravate the crowds.^[117]
<#cite_note-DuvaR-121> ^[118] <#cite_note-122>

On 12 May, extensive security measures were taken before and during
Kılıçdaroğlu's rally in Samsun <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsun>
following the rumours of assassination attempts of Kılıçdaroğlu.
Citizens who wanted to attend the rally held in Republic Square were
searched twice. Snipers were placed on the roofs of buildings located
around the square. İmamoğlu and Kılıçdaroğlu, who took the stage to make
their speeches, were seen wearing bulletproof vests. While Kılıçdaroğlu
was giving his speech, a large guard group accompanied him on the stage
armed.^[119] <#cite_note-123> ^[120] <#cite_note-124>

While visiting the burials of citizens who lost their lives during the
earthquake in Adıyaman Province <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ad%C4%B1yaman_Province>, Kılıçdaroğlu was subjected to a verbal attack
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_attack> while he was reciting Al-
Fatiha <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Fatiha>. The same day, another
person attempted a physical attack.^[121] <#cite_note-125> ^[122]
<#cite_note-126>

Two days after the attack on İmamoğlu, Kılıçdaroğlu's vehicle was
attacked with stones in Sakarya <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sakarya_Province>. The 15-year-old attacker was released after
Kılıçdaroğlu decided not to press charges and he also asked for the
anonymity of the child's identity.^[123] <#cite_note-127>

      Fake videos[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=25>]

On the Sunday before the elections Erdoğan showed an altered version of
an election commercial belonging to his main challenger Kılıçdaroğlu.
This commercial was edited with footage of Murat Karayılan <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murat_Karay%C4%B1lan>, one of the founders of the
PKK <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party>, in an
attempt to link Kilicdaroglu with the PKK.^[125] <#cite_note-
DW_2023_fake_video_fact_checking-129> ^[126] <#cite_note-
Euronews_2023_on_fake_media_interference-130> In a television interview,
Erdoğan was asked about the footage. He replied that it did not matter
whether it was manipulated or not, and insisted that the claim the video
made was nevertheless true.^[127] <#cite_note-131> Similarly,
presidential spokesman İbrahim Kalın <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
%C4%B0brahim_Kal%C4%B1n> said "Video edited by a group of witty young
people. The elements put together in the video are real".^[128]
<#cite_note-132> Kılıçdaroğlu called Erdoğan "fraudulent video
fabricator".^[129] <#cite_note-133> Kılıçdaroğlu also filed a 1 million
TRY non-pecuniary damage lawsuit against Erdoğan through his lawyer
Celal Çelik.^[130] <#cite_note-cumhuriyet1-134> On 25 May, the Ankara
6th Criminal Court of Peace blocked access to a troll account that
shared fake footage used by Erdoğan during the election process, on the
grounds that it "attacks personal rights".^[130] <#cite_note-

circulated before he dropped out of the race.^[131] <#cite_note-
Guardian_2023_fake_media_election_interference_reporting-135> İnce
claimed that deepfake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake>
technology had been used to make the video and stated he had suffered
"character assassination <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

public prosecutors for not protecting him from the "fury of slander
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation>".^[126] <#cite_note-
Euronews_2023_on_fake_media_interference-130> Erdoğan phoned İnce to
express his support and condemned the video, calling the video "Gülenist

the past.^[132] <#cite_note-136>


      Block of Ekşi Sözlük[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=26>]

One day before the election, the website Ekşi Sözlük <https://

access reasoned as "for the protection of national security and public
order".^[133] <#cite_note-137>


      Reporting of the results[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=27>]

On election night, the CHP complained about reports of Erdogan leading
in the polls by the Anadolu Agency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Anadolu_Agency> and produced its own numbers that held Kilicdaroglu as
the leading candidate.^[32] <#cite_note-:3-33> After Ömer Çelik
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96mer_%C3%87elik> of the AKP accused
the CHP of trying to seize the will of the nation, Ekrem İmamoğlu
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekrem_%C4%B0mamo%C4%9Flu> of the CHP
justified the reports of the opposition as they had learned from the
past.^[32] <#cite_note-:3-33> Anadolu is known to show the governing AKP
as the leader with a large advantage in the first hours.^[32]
<#cite_note-:3-33> ^[134] <#cite_note-138> The first results mainly come
from smaller rural towns, where Erdogan and his AK party are generally
popular.^[135] <#cite_note-139>

There were also criticisms directed at the slow pace of counting ballots
cast abroad. At the time of 90% of domestic ballots were counted, only
30.8% of ballots from abroad had been counted. Ahmet Yener of the
Supreme Election Council said these delays were "normal" and that the
increase in the number of ballots and contesting parties slowed
counting.^[136] <#cite_note-140>

The YSP demanded a repetition of the election for Gaziantep, where
according to the YSP two thousand potential YSP voters were not able to
vote as they were inscribed as members of the ballot committee by the
Patriotic Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Party_(Turkey)>
(VP) without informing them.^[137] <#cite_note-:5-141> The request was
deemed an unreasonable objection by the provincial election
presidency.^[137] <#cite_note-:5-141>


      Azerbaijani and Russian interference allegations[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_presidential_election&action=edit&section=28>]

A few days before the first round, Kılıçdaroğlu and the CHP accused
Russia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia> of foreign electoral
interference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Foreign_electoral_intervention>, claiming it to be the source of many
"plots <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)>, montages and
deepfakes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfakes>".^[138] <#cite_note-

<#cite_note-CNN_fake_media_election_interference_reporting-142>

After Oğan's endorsement of Erdoğan, journalist Demirağ claimed that
Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ilham_Aliyev> arranged the meeting between Erdoğan and Oğan. Istanbul
Metropolitan Municipality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Istanbul_Metropolitan_Municipality> assembly member, Good Party group
deputy chairman İbrahim Özkan criticized Oğan, saying that "he [Oğan]
will do whatever Aliyev says".^[141] <#cite_note-145> Azerbaijani
journalist Afgan Mukhtarli <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Afgan_Mukhtarli> said that "pro-Aliyev media and trolls" campaigned
against Kılıçdaroğlu, and adding that "Oğan has close relations with the
Azerbaijani government", and that "Aliyev's role is certain in Oğan's
decision".^[142] <#cite_note-146> A journalist asked Oğan if he met with
Aliyev before taking this decision. Upon the question Oğan said that his
interlocutors are Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu.^[143] <#cite_note-147> On 23
May, Adil Aliyev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_Aliyev>, deputy
chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan <https://

The ballot boxes used in the second round abroad were brought to Turkey

As no candidate was able to secure a majority of votes, a runoff took
place between the top two finishers, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal
Kılıçdaroğlu, on 28 May.^[145] <#cite_note-NYT_runoff-149> Erdoğan, the
incumbent president coming into the election, received 49.52% of the

<#cite_note-152> the Supreme Election Council <https://en.wikipedia.org/

Erdoğan expressed his thanks to his supporters in a speech in Istanbul,
saying that all 85 million citizens of the country were the "victors" in
the elections,^[151] <#cite_note-155> while taunting his opponent's
defeat with the words "Bye, bye, bay Kemal" ("bay" means "mr." in
Turkish and has the same pronunciation as "bye").^[152] <#cite_note-156>
Kılıçdaroğlu conceded defeat, saying, "My real sadness is about
difficulties awaiting this country." He vowed to continue fighting
against Erdoğan. He urged his supporters to continue to fight to uphold
democratic principles and expressed frustration at the massive influx of
refugees in his country, commenting that "Turkish people have become
second class citizens."^[153] <#cite_note-157> Özdağ described the
election results a pyrrhic victory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
