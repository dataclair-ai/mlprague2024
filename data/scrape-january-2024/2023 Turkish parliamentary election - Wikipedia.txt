AKP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)>

Parliamentary elections were held in Turkey on 14 May 2023, alongside
presidential elections <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2023_Turkish_presidential_election>, to elect all 600 members of the
Grand National Assembly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey>. The incoming members formed the 28th
Parliament of Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
28th_Parliament_of_Turkey>. The elections had originally been scheduled
to take place on June 18, but the government moved them forward by a
month to avoid coinciding with the university exams, the Hajj pilgrimage
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj> and the start of the summer
holidays <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_vacation>.^[1]
<#cite_note-2> Prior to the election, the electoral threshold <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_threshold> for a party to enter
parliament was lowered from 10% to 7% by the ruling party.^[2]
<#cite_note-3>

The elections were contested by a total of 24 political parties. Some
parties decided to participate in the elections as part of an electoral
alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance>, many of
which were formed for the previous 2018 election <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Turkish_parliamentary_election> and had been
expanded since. The governing Justice and Development Party <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)> (AKP) of
incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan> lead the People's Alliance <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Alliance_(Turkey)>, which also included
the Nationalist Movement Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nationalist_Movement_Party> (MHP), the Great Union Party <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Union_Party> (BBP) and the New Welfare Party
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Welfare_Party> (YRP). The largest
opposition alliance was headed by the main opposition Republican
People's Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Republican_People%27s_Party_(Turkey)> (CHP) and included five other
parties. These included the Good Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Good_Party> (İYİ), the Felicity Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Felicity_Party> (SP), the Democrat Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Democrat_Party_(Turkey,_current)> (DP) and two other parties headed by
former senior AKP politicians, namely the Democracy and Progress Party
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_and_Progress_Party> (DEVA) of
former economy minister Ali Babacan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ali_Babacan> and the Future Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Future_Party_(Turkey)> (GP) of former Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Davuto%C4%9Flu>.^[/citation needed
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] The pro-
Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Peoples%27_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)> (HDP) opted to run on the lists of
the Party of Greens and the Left Future <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Party_of_Greens_and_the_Left_Future> (YSGP) in light of a potential
closure case. The YSGP itself headed the left-wing Labour and Freedom
Alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_and_Freedom_Alliance>
along with the Workers' Party of Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Workers%27_Party_of_Turkey_(2017)> (TİP). Two smaller alliances, the
Ancestral Alliance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Alliance> of
presidential candidate Sinan Oğan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sinan_O%C4%9Fan> and the Union of Socialist Forces <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Socialist_Forces>, also participated in
the elections for the first time.^[3] <#cite_note-4>

The People's Alliance retained its majority in the parliament with 323
MPs. The AKP, led by incumbent president Erdoğan, won the highest
percentage of the vote with 36%, though it suffered its worst result
since 2002. MHP, the second largest party of the People's Alliance,
outperformed expectations and won 10.1% of the votes. The alliance
overall won just under 50% of the vote. The Nation Alliance only
marginally improved on its 2018 vote, winning a combined 34% and 212
MPs. The Labour and Freedom Alliance suffered a decline in their vote,
winning just over 10% and 66 seats. No other electoral alliance won
seats. The election resulted in seven parties entering the parliament,
which is a record in Turkish politics.^[/citation needed <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

Many smaller parties ran on the lists of larger ones to avoid splitting
the vote. Prior to the election, the CHP caused controversy by fielding
77 DEVA, Felicity Party, Future Party, and Democrat Party candidates on
its own lists, of which 39 (14 DEVA, 10 Felicity, 10 Future, 3
Democrats, 1 IYI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Party>, and 1 Party
for Change in Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Party_for_Change_in_Turkey>) were elected — a significantly higher
proportion than these parties' national share of support.^[4]
<#cite_note-5> These included former AKP ministers such as Sadullah
Ergin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadullah_Ergin> (running as a DEVA
candidate), who was widely criticised for his role as Justice Minister
in the Ergenekon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergenekon_(allegation)>
conspiracy against the Turkish Armed Forces <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Turkish_Armed_Forces>. The AKP, meanwhile, was criticised for
fielding members of the Free Cause Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Free_Cause_Party> (HÜDA PAR), a party known for its ties to the Kurdish
Hezbollah <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_Hezbollah>, as
candidates.^[/citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

    Electoral system[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Turkish_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=1>]

The 600 members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey> will be elected
by party-list proportional representation <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation> in 87 electoral districts
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_districts_of_Turkey>, by the
D'Hondt method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method>. For the
purpose of legislative elections, 77 of Turkey's 81 provinces serve as
single districts. Due to their large populations, the provinces of Bursa
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa> and Izmir <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir> are divided into two districts, while the
provinces of Ankara <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara> and Istanbul
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul> are each divided into
three.^[5] <#cite_note-6>

According to the Constitution of Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Constitution_of_Turkey>, any amendment to the election law can only
apply a year after it comes into effect.^[6] <#cite_note-7>


      Lowering of the electoral threshold[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=2>]

At the initiative of the ruling AKP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)> and its main political ally MHP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Movement_Party>, the national
electoral threshold <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_threshold>
for a party to enter parliament was lowered from 10% to 7%.^[7]
<#cite_note-8> This was the first lowering of the threshold since it was
introduced by the military junta following the 1980 Turkish coup d'état
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat>.^[8]
<#cite_note-xinhua-9>

There is no threshold for independent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Independent_(politician)> candidates.^[9] <#cite_note-10> Political
parties can also opt to contest the election in a political alliance
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_alliance> with other parties,
removing the 7% requirement as long as the alliance as a whole wins more
than 7% of the vote in total.^[10] <#cite_note-11>

Other amendments to the election law includes the distribution of seats.
Previously, parliamentary seats were distributed based on the vote share
of each election alliance in any given district. Now, the seats are
distributed based solely on the vote share of each political party in
that district. If applied to the previous elections, the results would
have been slightly more in line with the preferences of the voters on
local level. For example, one Erzurum seat <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Erzurum_(electoral_district)> from IYI <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Good_Party> (4th largest party in Erzurum) would have gone to HDP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)>
(3rd largest party in Erzurum) and one Elazığ seat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaz%C4%B1%C4%9F_(electoral_district)> from CHP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_People%27s_Party> (3rd largest
party in Elazığ) to MHP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nationalist_Movement_Party> (2nd largest party in Elazığ).^[11]
<#cite_note-12>


      Electoral districts[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=3>]

Turkey is split into 87 electoral districts <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Electoral_district>, which elect a certain number of Members
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament#Turkey> to the
Grand National Assembly of Turkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey>. The Assembly has a total of 600
seats, with each electoral district allocated a certain number of MPs in
proportion to their population. The Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Electoral_Council_of_Turkey>
conducts population reviews of each district before the election and can
increase or decrease a district's number of seats according to their
electorate.

In all but four cases, electoral districts share the same name and
borders as the 81 provinces <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Provinces_of_Turkey>, with the exceptions being Ankara <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara>, Bursa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bursa>, Izmir <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izmir> and Istanbul
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul>. Provinces electing between 19
and 36 MPs are split into two electoral districts, while any province
electing above 36 MPs is divided into three. As the country's most
populous provinces, Bursa and Izmir are divided into two subdistricts
while Ankara and Istanbul are divided into three. The distribution of
elected MPs per electoral district is shown below.^[12] <#cite_note-13>

For political parties to achieve (nationwide) ballot access <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomination_rules#Turkey>, they must be eligible to
meet the requirements set by Law no. 298 on "Basic Provisions on
Elections and Electoral Registers".^[13] <#cite_note-14>

The Green Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(Turkey)>,
founded in September 2020, has been barred from the election by the
Interior Ministry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ministry_of_Interior_(Turkey)> despite a court ruling against the
ministry.^[14] <#cite_note-15> ^[15] <#cite_note-:0-16> As of 2022 the
establishment of the Humanity and Freedom Party had been awaiting the
Constitutional Court for four years after the completion of the legal
process.^[16] <#cite_note-17>

On 11 March 2023, the Supreme Election Council <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Election_Council_(Turkey)> confirmed that
36 parties were eligible to run in the elections.^[17] <#cite_note-18>

The table below shows the places of alliances, parties, and independent
candidates <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_candidates> in the
order they appear on the ballot paper. However, the ballot paper is not
the same in every electoral district as some parties do not participate
in every electoral district or are on another party's list.

      Political violence[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Turkish_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=10>]

During the election campaign, several occurrences that took place have
been labelled as political violence. On 31 March 2023, the Istanbul
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul> headquarters of the Good Party
was targeted in a shooting attack.^[21] <#cite_note-27> No one was
harmed in the shooting. Akşener criticised Erdoğan after the attack by
saying "A political party cannot be intimidated one and a half months
before an election. We are not afraid. I fear nothing but God. Mr. Recep
(Erdoğan), I am not afraid of you. But you are the president and you are
responsible for every citizen in this country." The attackers were
emboldened by the president's harsh words against the opposition,
Akşener said.^[22] <#cite_note-28> ^[23] <#cite_note-29> ^[24]
<#cite_note-30> Upon investigation, it became clear that a nighttime
security guard had fired his gun at burglars – only to hit the building
by mistake with two stray bullets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Stray_bullet>. President Erdoğan said in response to Akşener "The truth
has come out, are you now going to apologize to me?"^[25] <#cite_note-31>

Recent attacks on other parties have raised issues of political
polarisation and security in the country.^[26] <#cite_note-32> On 1 May,
a group of unidentified individuals armed with guns and sticks assaulted
HUDAPAR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Cause_Party> youth members
in Mersin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersin>. HUDAPAR was hosting an
election campaign stand to help their electoral ally the AK Party
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK_Party>. The HDP <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)> denied links
to the attack, and urged its supporters to refrain against
provocations.^[27] <#cite_note-33>
