Parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Bulgaria> on 2 April 2023 to elect members of the National Assembly
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(Bulgaria)>.^[1]
<#cite_note-:1-1> These were initially scheduled to be held before
November 2026;^[2] <#cite_note-2> however, as no government was approved
by the 48th Parliament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
48th_National_Assembly_of_Bulgaria>, Bulgarian President <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bulgaria> Rumen Radev <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumen_Radev> announced in January 2023 that he
would call a snap election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Snap_election>.^[1] <#cite_note-:1-1>

The GERB—SDS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GERB%E2%80%94SDS> placed
first with 69 seats, closely followed by PP–DB <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PP%E2%80%93DB> which won 64. ITN <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_Such_a_People> also entered the
parliament after having fallen out in the 2022 election.^[3]
<#cite_note-3> ^[4] <#cite_note-4>

On 15 May, President Rumen Radev granted GERB—SDS a mandate to form a
government, and the party nominated Bulgaria's European Commissioner,
Mariya Gabriel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariya_Gabriel>, for prime
minister. GERB—SDS sought to form a government with rival PP–DB to end
the political deadlock that had resulted in numerous inconclusive
elections. Although initially reluctant, with co-leader and former prime
minister Kiril Petkov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiril_Petkov>
pledging to rule out working with GERB—SDS, the PP–DB later agreed to
negotiate. However, the talks between the two parties broke down on 27
May after the leak of a video in which the leaders of the PP–DB
expressed their intentions to reduce GERB—SDS' influence within the
civil service. President Radev subsequently handed a mandate on 29 May
to the PP–DB to form a government, which nominated Nikolai Denkov
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Denkov> for prime minister.
However, Radev recommended Denkov return the mandate due to the video's
release, which sparked protests and criticism from PP–DB, arguing the
president’s statement was unconstitutional. GERB—SDS agreed to restart
negotiations with PP–DB to form a "government of experts." Denkov
announced on 2 June that the two parties had reached an agreement on the
composition of a cabinet with certain modifications that removed
"inflammatory political figures". Parliament voted to approve the new
GERB—SDS–PP–DB government on 6 June with Denkov as prime minister.


    Background[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=1>]

The National Assembly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
National_Assembly_(Bulgaria)> remained fragmented following the 2022
election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2022_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election>, the third snap election since
2021, and no party was able to form a governing coalition.^[1]
<#cite_note-:1-1> GERB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GERB> and the
Movement for Rights and Freedoms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms> (DPS) did not have a majority, holding
only 103 of the 121 seats needed. Bulgarian Rise <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Rise> (BV) and Revival <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_(Bulgarian_political_party)>, which held a
combined 39 seats, are considered Eurosceptic <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Eurosceptic> and sympathetic to Russia,^[5] <#cite_note-5>
similarly to the Bulgarian Socialist Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Bulgarian_Socialist_Party> (BSP) with 25 seats. Although generally
pro-EU <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-EU>, the remaining parties and
alliances with seats opposed Boyko Borisov <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Boyko_Borisov>'s past government and refused any possibility of a
coalition with GERB due to disagreements over corruption.^[6]
<#cite_note-6>

On 18 October, Borisov announced that his attempts to broker a coalition
government prior to the first sitting of the new Assembly were
unsuccessful.^[7] <#cite_note-7> The following day, the Assembly failed
to elect a speaker during its first meeting, the first time this ever
occurred. After multiple failed attempts, the Assembly elected its
oldest member, the GERB MP Vezhdi Rashidov <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Vezhdi_Rashidov>, as speaker on 21 October, after he was nominated
by Korneliya Ninova <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korneliya_Ninova>,
the leader of BSP, as a consensus candidate.^[8] <#cite_note-8> ^[9]
<#cite_note-9> The gridlock to form a new government persisted
throughout October and November 2022 and before a first or second
mandate was given, President Rumen Radev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Rumen_Radev> stated that he would delay handing over the third mandate
for government formation until after the New Year <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year> so as to delay elections until March
2023 and avoid the most difficult winter period.^[10] <#cite_note-10>

On 2 December, Radev stated that he would hand the government mandate to
the election's winner GERB the following Monday. On 5 December, Radev
granted the first mandate to GERB's nominee, Nikolay Gabrovski. One week
later, on 12 December, Gabrovski proposed a new government.^[11]
<#cite_note-11> His prime ministership was rejected by Parliament (113 /
for/, 125 /against/, 2 /absent/) two days later on 14 December, with MPs
from the DPS and BV voting in favour alongside GERB.^[12]
<#cite_note-12> On 3 January, Radev gave the second mandate to PP's
candidate, Nikolai Denkov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nikolai_Denkov>,^[13] <#cite_note-13> but his prime ministership was
also rejected by Parliament (63 /for/, 84 /against/, 30 /abstain/, 63 /
absent/).^[14] <#cite_note-14> Radev gave the third mandate to Ninova,
who was unable to form a government in a deadlocked parliament.^[15]
<#cite_note-:0-15> ^[16] <#cite_note-16> As none of the three mandates
produced a government, a new election was scheduled.


    Electoral system[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=2>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation> from 31
multi-member constituencies ranging in size from 4 to 19 seats. The
electoral threshold is 4% for parties, with seats allocated according to
the largest remainder method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Largest_remainder_method> using a Hare quota.^[17] <#cite_note-17> ^[18]

      Constitutional powers of the President[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=8>]

PP, DB, and GERB have accused Radev of meddling in political affairs, as
well as internal party politics, which is in breach of the
constitutional duties.^[28] <#cite_note-28> ^[29] <#cite_note-29> ^[30]
<#cite_note-30> BSP have consistently accused Radev and the caretaker
Second Donev Government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Second_Donev_Government> of allegedly meddling in internal party
affairs.^[31] <#cite_note-31> ^[32] <#cite_note-32> BSP sent an official
complain to the OSCE and PACE alleging illegal meddling by the caretaker
government and president in their internal politics, as well as the
election campaign after an interview by justice minister Krum Zarkov
criticising the party leadership.^[33] <#cite_note-33> The PP–DB
coalition also accused the president of meddling after Radev called them
"the parties of war" referring to their support of sending arms to
Ukraine.^[34] <#cite_note-34> ^[35] <#cite_note-35> ITN believes that
the president should have more powers compared to the current roles
outlined in the constitution, even advocating for a transition to a
presidential republic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Presidential_republic> with ITN calling for a referendum to be held on
the decision.^[36] <#cite_note-36> ^[37] <#cite_note-37>


      Magnitsky sanctions announcement[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?
      title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=9>]

On 10 February 2023, the United States announced a new group of
sanctions based on the Magnitsky Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Magnitsky_Act>. The sanctions targeted former finance minister in the
Second <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Borisov_Government> and
Third <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Borisov_Government> Borisov
Governments, Vladislav Goranov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vladislav_Goranov>, former energy minister in the Stanishev Government
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanishev_Government>, Rumen Ovcharov
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumen_Ovcharov>, the leader of
Russophiles for the Revival of the Fatherland, Nikolay Malinov, as well
as two former heads of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozloduy_Nuclear_Power_Plant>.^[38]
<#cite_note-38> The group were accused of corruption, financial
mismanagement and increasing Russian influence.^[39] <#cite_note-39>

The announcement served as a reminder of endemic corruption, as well as
the political class's close ties to Russia.^[40] <#cite_note-40> ^[41]
<#cite_note-41> The announcement provoked a range of differing reactions
from political parties and politicians in Bulgaria. Caretaker Minister
of the Interior, Ivan Demerdzhiev, characterised the sanctions as "slap
in the face" of the Bulgarian judicial system, showing it to be
incapable of rooting out corruption,^[42] <#cite_note-42> while
caretaker Deputy Prime Minister for European Union resources, Atanas
Pekanov, and caretaker justice minister, Krum Zarkov, described it as a
sign by the US that progress wasn't fast enough on the topic of judicial
reform.^[43] <#cite_note-43> A similar message was echoed by members of
the PP–DB coalition, with DB member of parliament, Atanas Slavov, saying
that the new packet of sanctions showed the failings of the current
general prosecutor, Ivan Geshev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ivan_Geshev>, and that a link existed between GERB, DPS, and BSP due to
the former or current connection of the sanctioned figures to those
parties.^[44] <#cite_note-44>

A more mixed reaction came from GERB and the BSP. Borisov insisted that
the party had distanced itself away from Goranov, and claimed he had
information that the United States was working on sanctions against PP
co-leaders Petkov and Vasilev, for financial mismanagement during their
time in office.^[45] <#cite_note-45> Other GERB figures, like GERB
member of parliament Toma Bikov, insist that evidence must be provided
before any judgement can be made.^[46] <#cite_note-46> BSP, of whom
Rumen Ovcharov remains a member, gave a voice to Rumen Ovcharov at the
recent Congress, at which he insisted he was innocent and that the
sanctions were meant to worsen Russian-Bulgarian relations.^[47]
<#cite_note-47> Leader of Bulgarian Rise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bulgarian_Rise>, Stefan Yanev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Stefan_Yanev>, indicated that he did not believe that the new sanctions
would have an impact on the upcoming election, calling it another
scandal that undermined trust between political parties, he did,
however, endorse the idea of a thorough judicial reform as long as it
kept the judicial branch independent.^[48] <#cite_note-48>

Nikolay Malinov, the leader of the party Russophiles for the Revival of
the Fatherland, which is contesting the elections as part of the Neutral
Bulgaria coalition, insists that he has never received funding from
Russia, as alleged by the sanctions, and that he is proud to be included
in the list as it showed his opposition to United States influence in
Bulgaria.^[49] <#cite_note-49>


      Allegations of vote buying[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?
      title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=10>]

Ivan Demerdzhiev, the minister of the interior in the caretaker
government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government>,
announced on 17 February that he expects increased attempts at vote
buying during this election campaign, with a meeting of Oblast Directors
of the Ministry of Interior being dedicated to this topic.^[50]

    Results[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=12>]

According to parallel counts of sample polling stations by several
polling agencies, the final result was a close race between GERB—SDS and
PP–DB, with all projecting GERB—SDS to be narrowly in the lead. All also
suggest that V, DPS, and BSPzB would make it into the parliament, and
there was conflicting data on whether ITN would win seats as well.^[51]
<#cite_note-53> ^[52] <#cite_note-54>

The following table outlines the results by party. The national
threshold <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_threshold> at 4% is
calculated using total votes for parties and independent <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician> candidates only, and not
the total of valid votes, which include "None of the above <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above>" votes. As such, ITN wins seats
despite seemingly falling below 4%.

    Aftermath[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=15>]


      Allegations of count irregularities[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=16>]

According to the Central Electoral Commission, 22% of election protocols
were entered incorrectly,^[55] <#cite_note-57> and some members of PP–DB
have shown examples of votes being counted incorrectly.^[56]
<#cite_note-58>


      Government formation[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=17>]

As per the constitution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Constitution_of_Bulgaria>, the president <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
President_of_Bulgaria> is required to hand a mandate for government
formation to the largest parliamentary group, GERB–SDS. If they fail to
propose a government within seven days, or if that government is
rejected by the Bulgarian Parliament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
National_Assembly_(Bulgaria)>, the president is required to hand the
second mandate to the second-largest parliamentary group, PP–DB. If the
second mandate also fails to produce a government, the president grants
a third mandate to a party of their choice. If no government is approved
by parliament after all three mandates have been returned, fresh
elections will be scheduled.

Andrius Tursa, a political risk consult from Teneo <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teneo>, commented that "a temporary technocratic
cabinet or another [sixth] vote remain the most likely outcomes of the
election" as the margin of GERB's victory was too narrow for them to
rule but large enough that no coalition could govern without them,
effectively preserving the years-long political deadlock. This potential
technocratic government could be supported by both GERB–SDS and PP–DB in
order to pass a budget for the year and address the increasing inflation
and cost of living in the country.^[57] <#cite_note-59> Soon after the
election, Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev announced that their party would
not support a government proposed by GERB.^[58] <#cite_note-60> This was
reaffirmed three days later when all four co-leaders of PP–DB announced
that none of the parties in the coalition would support a GERB-proposed
government, or one that included GERB.^[59] <#cite_note-61> Despite
this, Borisov repeatedly stated that his preferred outcome would be a
government between the two.^[60] <#cite_note-62> ^[61] <#cite_note-63>
The only form of cooperation between the two groups, that PP–DB were
open to, was GERB providing support for their proposed government with
the second mandate.^[62] <#cite_note-64> During the negotiations,
Borisov requested that if they wanted GERB's support, PP–DB needed to
publicly release their proposed cabinet.^[63] <#cite_note-65> When they
did, Borisov criticized the inclusion of PP members as ministers,
suggested the inclusion of GERB–SDS ministers, and began negotiations
with the other parties the following day.^[64] <#cite_note-66> Nikolay
Denkov stated that negotiations with GERB regarding cabinet members
would not be held.^[65] <#cite_note-67> Following the first mandate
being given to GERB's candidate, PP–DB reaffirmed that they would not
support it.^[66] <#cite_note-68>

Another possibility is for GERB and DPS to work with BSP,^[67]
<#cite_note-69> something Borisov did not rule out.^[68] <#cite_note-70>
^[69] <#cite_note-71> This has been referred to, especially by PP–DB
supporters, as the 'Magnitsky coalition', following the Magnitsky
sanctions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_legislation> that
incriminated MPs from all three parties.^[70] <#cite_note-72> ^[71]
<#cite_note-73> Ninova and other senior BSP members stated that the BSP
is open to discussion with everyone, but would consult with the party
members before a decision is made on whether they would support a
potential government or not.^[72] <#cite_note-74> ^[73] <#cite_note-75>
When governmental formation negotiations began, Ninova stated that she
would not support a GERB government, unless specifically offered to join
a coalition, in which case she would ask her party.^[74] <#cite_note-76>
^[75] <#cite_note-77> Borisov in turn said that if PP–DB did not support
his government, he could rule with BSP and DPS under certain
conditions.^[76] <#cite_note-78> Soon after the first mandate was given
to GERB, Ninova announced that her party would not support it.^[77]
<#cite_note-BalkanInsight-79>

After a three day deadlock, the National Assembly approved GERB's Rosen
Zhelyazkov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosen_Zhelyazkov> as its
speaker on 19 April, allowing for government formation talks to
officially begin. Zhelyazkov was supported by GERB–SDS and PP–DB, who
had agreed that each of them would retain control of the speakership for
three months.^[78] <#cite_note-speaker_elected-80> On 10 May GERB
announced that their PM nominee is Mariya Gabriel <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariya_Gabriel>, Bulgaria's European
commissioner.^[79] <#cite_note-81> President Radev gave her the first
mandate on 15 May.^[77] <#cite_note-BalkanInsight-79> Gabriel has
attempted to win over some of the PP–DB members by making concessions to
the coalition, including proposing to remove Ivan Geshev <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Geshev> as Chief Prosecutor. However, PP–DB
remained steadfast in denying any negotiation with GERB, and the
attempted courting soured relations with the BSP. Additionally, Geshev
stated that an unnamed high ranking individual requested he resign and
handed him resignation papers, which he tore up in front of them.^[80]
<#cite_note-82>

On 22 May, GERB–SDS and PP–DB announced that they had reached a surprise
power-sharing deal (pending approval by MPs of both entities) for at
least 18 months, whereby the premiership would be rotated between the
two.^[81] <#cite_note-83> ^[82] <#cite_note-84> According to the
Financial Times <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times>, "under
the power-sharing agreement, the PP–DB’s Nikolai Denkov <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Denkov>, a former education minister, will
become prime minister, with [Mariya] Gabriel serving as his deputy and
foreign minister. Gabriel will take over the premiership after nine
months as the parties rotate the leadership." The deal was motivated by
a desire to end the gridlock that had resulted in multiple inconclusive
snap elections over two years, to move closer to fulfilling requirements
for membership in the Eurozone, and to implement electronic voting as
well as constitutional and comprehensive judicial reform.^[83]
<#cite_note-85> ^[84] <#cite_note-86> Kiril Petkov <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiril_Petkov>, one of the leaders of PP–DB,
nonetheless apologized to those who had voted for him based on a promise
of not dealing with GERB.^[85] <#cite_note-87>

On 26 May 2023, Radostin Vasilev, a former ITN <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_Such_a_People> MP who founded the Civic
Movement Strong Bulgaria, released a video snippet seemingly showing
Kiril Petkov and Asen Vasilev working towards keeping Borisov out of a
court case and agreeing to the appointments of key security services
with approval of foreign organizations (particularly the EU and
US).^[86] <#cite_note-88> He further announced that he was leaving the
PP–DB group and would vote against the Denkov-Gabriel rotational
government, urging fellow MPs from PP to vote against it as well.^[87]
<#cite_note-89> The release of the tapes has triggered calls by GERB MPs
to renegotiate certain elements of the agreements with PP–DB, especially
about the composition of Denkov's Cabinet.^[88] <#cite_note-90> ^[89]
<#cite_note-91> On 27 May, Mariya Gabriel, GERB's PM candidate who had
led negotiations with PP, announced that government negotiations between
GERB and PP were suspended due to a loss of trust because of the
contents of the video tape, which included the leaders of PP admitting
they wished to lower GERBs influence within the civil service.^[90]
<#cite_note-92> GERB announced they would be willing to restart
government talks with PP, if they pledged to form a government composed
of "experts, which both parties could trust".^[91] <#cite_note-93> On 27
May, Nikolay Denkov (the PM candidate for PP) confirmed that despite the
suspension of talks, he was still in talks with Mariya Gabriel, and that
he hoped to re-start official negotiations when the second mandate was
officially submitted.^[92] <#cite_note-94>

On 28 May, Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Democrats_for_a_Strong_Bulgaria> announced their full support for
Nikolay Denkov as PM, indicating that Democratic Bulgaria was inclined
to support the government.^[93] <#cite_note-95>

On 29 May, President Rumen Radev handed the second mandate to PP–DB's
Prime Minister candidate, Nikolay Denkov, urging Denkov to return the
second mandate unfulfilled due to the loss of trust caused by the leaked
tapes.^[94] <#cite_note-96> This statement was criticised by PP–DB as
unconstitutional^[95] <#cite_note-97> and led to a protest outside the
Presidential building, with calls for Radev to be impeached, as well as
to curtail the powers of the Presidency.^[96] <#cite_note-98> Counter
protests in support of President Radev were also held.^[97] <#cite_note-99>

On 31 May, GERB and PP–DB announced that they re-opened talks about
government formation, with meetings taking place between key PP–DB and
GERB leaders.^[98] <#cite_note-100>

On 2 June, Nikolay Denkov (PP–DB's PM candidate) confirmed that an
agreement had been reached about the composition of the cabinet, with
some changes taking place to "take out inflammatory political figures
and give the government a more expert look". He also confirmed the new
composition was approved by all the constituent members of PP–DB.^[99]
<#cite_note-101> A meeting was also held on that day with the Movement
for Rights and Freedoms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms>, where changes to the constitution
were discussed.^[100] <#cite_note-102> After this meeting, DPS confirmed
that they would not "impede" the formation of the Denkov-Gabriel
government, and that they would support continued talks about making
changes to the constitution.^[101] <#cite_note-103>

Denkov's government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkov-
Gabriel_Government> was approved by the parliament on 6 June.^[102]
