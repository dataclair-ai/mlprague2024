	*Elected President*

Abdel Fattah el-Sisi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi>
Independent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician>

Presidential elections were held in Egypt <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Egypt> in December 2023, as announced by the National Election
Authority,^[2] <#cite_note-es25sept-2> after speculation that the
elections might be held earlier than expected.^[3] <#cite_note-3>
Candidate registration was from 5–14 October 2023 and the election was
held in Egypt from 10 to 12 December;^[2] <#cite_note-es25sept-2>
expatriates voted from 1–3 December.^[4] <#cite_note-4>

Incumbent President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi>, who initially came to power in the aftermath of
the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat>, was eligible for re-election since
term limits were adjusted from four to six years by a constitutional
amendment in 2019 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2019_Egyptian_constitutional_referendum>, and he technically will not
have served as president for more than the maximum of 12 years at the
time of the election. His rule has been described as authoritarian
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian>.^[1] <#cite_note-expect-1>
^[5] <#cite_note-Truex_&_Tavana_2019-5> ^[6] <#cite_note-
foreignpolicy-6> ^[7] <#cite_note-hrw-7> ^[8] <#cite_note-8> ^[9]
<#cite_note-9> On 18 December he was reported to have won with 89.6% of
the vote. The voter turnout was stated to be 66.8% of registered
voters.^[10] <#cite_note-10> El-Sisi is set to be inaugurated for
another term by April 2024 at the latest.


    Background[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Egyptian_presidential_election&action=edit&section=1>]

Incumbent el-Sisi won the 2018 elections <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2018_Egyptian_presidential_election> with over 97% of the vote, and
faced only nominal opposition (a pro-government supporter, Moussa
Mostafa Moussa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moussa_Mostafa_Moussa>)
after several opposition figures were prevented from participating
following the military arrest of Sami Anan <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Sami_Hafez_Anan>,^[11] <#cite_note-11> ^[12] <#cite_note-12> ^[13]
<#cite_note-13> ^[14] <#cite_note-14> threats made to Ahmed Shafik
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Shafik> with old corruption charges
and an alleged sex tape <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Amateur_pornography>,^[15] <#cite_note-15> ^[16] <#cite_note-16> ^[17]
<#cite_note-17> and the withdrawal of Khaled Ali <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Ali> and Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Anwar_Esmat_Sadat> due to the overwhelming
obstacles presented, and violations committed, by the elections
committee.^[18] <#cite_note-18> ^[19] <#cite_note-19> ^[20] <#cite_note-20>

Since 2022, Egypt was in the midst of an economic crisis, including
record high inflation causing the Egyptian pound <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pound> to lose nearly half its value from
March 2022 to January 2023^[21] <#cite_note-21> and a shortage of
foreign currency, the latter of which driven in part by the Russian
invasion of Ukraine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine>. Prior to the crisis, roughly 30% of the
population was already living below the poverty line, with an additional
30% considered vulnerable to poverty. Furthermore, the country's
external debt bill tripled in the ten years prior.^[22] <#cite_note-22>
Egypt had put several state-owned companies and stakes up for sale
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization> in a bid to raise money,
and about half of the 2023/24 budget is allocated to debt servicing. The
IMF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund> has also
requested that the Egyptian pound transition to a fully floating
exchange rate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate> in
order for a round of loans to be released. Government spending on
projects without a return on investment, such as the New Administrative
Capital <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Administrative_Capital>, were
also blamed for contributing,^[23] <#cite_note-23> in addition to a
persistent trade deficit and continuing influence of the military in
economic affairs.^[24] <#cite_note-24> ^[25] <#cite_note-25> Moody's
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody%27s_Investors_Service> labeled
Egypt as one of the top five economies most at risk of defaulting on
foreign debt in 2023.^[26] <#cite_note-26>


    Electoral system[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Egyptian_presidential_election&action=edit&section=2>]

The president of Egypt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system> for a term of six years,
renewable once.^[27] <#cite_note-27>

To participate, a candidate can either secure the endorsement of 20 MPs
or "25,000 eligible voters across at least 15 governorates," with at
least 1,000 endorsements from each governorate.^[28] <#cite_note-

constitution:^[29] <#cite_note-29>

  * "A candidate must be an Egyptian citizen born to Egyptian parents
  * The candidate, their parents, and their spouse must not hold dual
    citizenship
  * The candidate must not have been denied their civil and political
    rights due to a criminal conviction

Beloved of the Egyptians <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians>".

The mobile phone of Ahmed Tantawi, considered the most prominent
chalenger to incumbent el-Sisi, was hacked using the Predator <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(spyware)> spyware.^[48] <#cite_note-48>
Citizen Lab <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Lab> and Google
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google>'s Threat Analysis Group indicated
that the attempts began as early as May 2023 and continued through
August, using various methods, leading Apple <https://en.wikipedia.org/

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)> the vulnerabilities
exploited by the spyware.^[49] <#cite_note-49> Tantawi suspended his
campaign for 48 hours on 27 September following harassment and arrests
of his supporters,^[50] <#cite_note-50> even though the European
Parliament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament> warned
the Egyptian government to not harass Tantawi or any other oppositional
figure.^[51] <#cite_note-51> Supporters of Tantawi also faced
difficulties in submitting endorsements.^[52] <#cite_note-52> ^[53]
<#cite_note-:0-53> Tantawi was unable to secure the required number of
public endorsements and was thus not approved as a candidate for the
election in October.^[54] <#cite_note-54> ^[55] <#cite_note-55>

On the evening of 2 October, small-scale anti-Sisi <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi> protests broke out in Mersa

burning photos of el-Sisi and chanting anti-Sisi statements.^[56]

    Aftermath[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2023_Egyptian_presidential_election&action=edit&section=8>]

According to official results shared by the National Elections Authority
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Elections_Authority>, turnout
was 66.8%, eclipsing the turnout from the 2012 Egyptian presidential
election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2012_Egyptian_presidential_election> that followed the 2011 Egyptian
revolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution>.
Egyptian media portrayed the election as a "great victory for the will
of the people," who were reportedly motivated to vote because of the
country's "state of stability and security." The opposition described
the election as a "farce <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sham_election>",
marred by corrupt practices and intimidation of opponents of the el-
Sisi, similar to the elections in 2018 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2018_Egyptian_presidential_election>. Multiple voters interviewed at the
entrance to several polling stations admitted that they had been paid
between 200 and 300 Egyptian pounds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Egyptian_pound> (US$6.46 to $9.69) by supporters of el-Sisi to come and
vote. There were also reports that security forces forcibly escorted
people waiting at bus stops or train stations to polling stations for
voting, and that civil servants were required to prove that they had
voted by showing their finger marked with election ink <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_ink>.^[57] <#cite_note-57>

The elections were described by multiple international organizations and
media outlets as not competitive.^[53] <#cite_note-:0-53> ^[58]
