General elections were held in Malta <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Malta> on 26 March 2022 to elect all members of the House of
Representatives <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Malta>.

The Labour Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Malta)>,
which had governed Malta since 2013 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2013_Maltese_general_election>, won a second term in 2017 election
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Maltese_general_election> under
then-leader Joseph Muscat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Muscat>.
Simon Busuttil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Busuttil>, the
leader of the opposition Nationalist Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Nationalist_Party_(Malta)>, resigned after the 2017 election and
was replaced by Adrian Delia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Adrian_Delia>. Muscat was faced with a political crisis <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Malta_political_crisis> and mass protests
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Maltese_protests> in
2019, after which he resigned as prime minister in January 2020. Robert
Abela <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Abela> succeeded him as
prime minister and leader of the Labour Party in January 2020, while
Bernard Grech <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Grech> succeeded
Delia later that year.

Journalists noted that the campaign was overshadowed by the Russian
invasion of Ukraine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine> and that it was the "quietest in
decades". Six political parties nominated their candidates for the 2022
general election. The Labour Party and its leader campaigned on
investing in green urbanism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Green_urbanism> and environmental issues <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Environmental_issues>, while the Nationalist Party pledged a one billion
investment in ten new economic sectors. The AD+PD <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD%2BPD> campaigned on proposals for LGBT rights
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Malta>, while the People's
Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Malta)>
campaigned on increasing the minimum wage <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Minimum_wage> and abolishing green passes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Digital_COVID_Certificate>. Additionally, ABBA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBA_(political_party)> supported the
investigation into abortion-rights <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Abortion-rights_movements> activists, while Volt Malta <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt_Malta> supported the legalisation of abortion
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Malta>. Opinion polls
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_Maltese_general_election> in the run-up to
the election indicated another victory for Labour Party.

The Labour Party retained its majority in parliament, winning a third
consecutive election for the first time since 1981 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Maltese_general_election> with 55.11% of the
popular vote, the largest share since 1955 <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/1955_Maltese_general_election>, marginally surpassing the 55.04% it
scored in 2017 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2017_Maltese_general_election>. Voter turnout was 86%. As a result of a
constitutional amendment, Article 52(A), passed before the elections,
twelve seats were added to the House of Representatives and were given
to women from both parties, so as to limit male dominance.^[1]
<#cite_note-genderbonus-1> Abela formed his new cabinet <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_Government_2022%E2%80%932027> four days
after the election.


    Background[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2022_Maltese_general_election&action=edit&section=1>]

Joseph Muscat in 2020 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Joseph_muscat_2.JPG>
Joseph Muscat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Muscat> served as
prime minister of Malta from 2013 until his resignation in 2020.

The previous election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2017_Maltese_general_election>, which was held in June 2017, saw the
Labour Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Malta)>, which
has governed the country since 2013, receive 55% of the popular vote and
win 37 out of 67 seats in the House of Representatives <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Malta>.^[2] <#cite_note-2> Despite
the allegations of corruption towards Joseph Muscat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Muscat>, who had served as Prime Minister
of Malta <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Malta> since
2013, the confidence of the government was renewed in this election.^[3]
<#cite_note-3> ^[4] <#cite_note-4> Following the election, Simon
Busuttil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Busuttil> resigned as
leader of the Nationalist Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nationalist_Party_(Malta)>, and was replaced by Adrian Delia <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Delia>.^[5] <#cite_note-5> ^[6]
<#cite_note-6> Daphne Caruana Galizia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Daphne_Caruana_Galizia>, a writer and anti-corruption activist <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption> who exposed Labour Party
politicians Konrad Mizzi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Mizzi>
and Keith Schembri <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Schembri> after
being named in the Panama Papers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Panama_Papers> leak, was assassinated in October 2017 in a car bomb
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_bomb> attack.^[7] <#cite_note-7> ^[8]
<#cite_note-8> ^[9] <#cite_note-9> The assassination eventually
culminated into a political crisis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2019_Malta_political_crisis> that reached its peak during 2019.^[10]
<#cite_note-10> Subsequently, mass protests <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Maltese_protests> were organised between November
2019 and January 2020 in Malta and among the Maltese diaspora <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_diaspora> internationally.^[11]
<#cite_note-11> ^[12] <#cite_note-12> Muscat announced his resignation
in December 2019, which took effect the following month.^[13]
<#cite_note-13> He remained in the House as a backbencher, but resigned
in October 2020.^[14] <#cite_note-14>

Robert Abela <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Abela> won the
subsequent Labour Party leadership election, defeating Chris Fearne
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Fearne>.^[15] <#cite_note-15> ^[16]
<#cite_note-16> ^[17] <#cite_note-17> He was sworn in on 13 January
2020.^[18] <#cite_note-18> Abela appointed Miriam Dalli <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Dalli> and Clyde Caruana <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Caruana> to his new cabinet.^[19]
<#cite_note-19> However, after not being included in Abela's new
cabinet, Deputy Labour Party leader Chris Cardona <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cardona> resigned and retired from
politics.^[20] <#cite_note-20> In October 2020, Delia lost the
leadership election to Bernard Grech <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bernard_Grech>, who then succeeded him as leader of the parliamentary
opposition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Leader_of_the_Opposition_(Malta)>.^[21] <#cite_note-21> ^[22]
<#cite_note-22> Education minister Justyne Caruana <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justyne_Caruana> resigned in December 2021,
following claims that she abused her power.^[23] <#cite_note-23> Labour
MP Silvio Grixti also resigned from the House that month.^[24]
<#cite_note-24>


    Electoral system[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2022_Maltese_general_election&action=edit&section=2>]

MPs are elected from 13 five-seat constituencies by single transferable
vote <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote>.^[25]
<#cite_note-:0-25> Candidates who pass the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagenbach-Bischoff_quota> in the first
round are elected, and any surplus votes transferred to the remaining
candidates, who will be elected if this enables them to pass the
quota.^[25] <#cite_note-:0-25> The lowest ranked candidates are then
eliminated one-by-one with their preferences transferred to other
candidates, who are elected as they pass the quotient, until all five
seats are filled.^[26] <#cite_note-:1-26> If a party wins a majority of
first preference votes but fails to achieve a parliamentary majority,
they are awarded seats to ensure a one-seat majority, if they are one of
only two parties to obtain seats.^[26] <#cite_note-:1-26> While the
ranked preferential <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting> system
used is technically proportional <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Proportional_representation>, the low number of seats per constituency
(five) means that parties can only receive seats if they receive at
least 16.7% of the vote,^[a] <#cite_note-27> so smaller parties are
excluded from representation. Consequently, Malta has a stable two-party
system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system>, with only the
Labour Party and Nationalist Party having a realistic chance of forming
a government.^[27] <#cite_note-28> ^[28] <#cite_note-29> Prior to the
2017 elections, when the Democratic Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Democratic_Party_(Malta)> won two seats while running in a joint
list with the Nationalist Party, the last time a party other than the
Labour Party or the Nationalist Party won seats was in 1962 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Maltese_general_election>.^[29]
<#cite_note-30> ^[30] <#cite_note-31>

In 2018 the government of Malta <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Government_of_Malta> lowered the national voting age to 16.^[31]
<#cite_note-32> During the last legislature a gender-corrective
mechanism was introduced, with Article 52A of the Constitution stating
that provides for up to 12 additional seats for unelected candidates
from "the under-represented sex" in case one of both makes up less than
40% of the elected MPs.^[32] <#cite_note-maltaind-20220328-33> Due to
the COVID-19 pandemic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic>,
arrangements were being made for drive-through voting.^[33]
<#cite_note-34> ^[34] <#cite_note-35> After much speculation, Abela
announced the election date on 20 February 2022, with the election set
for 26 March.^[35] <#cite_note-36> ^[36] <#cite_note-37> ^[37]
<#cite_note-38> ^[38] <#cite_note-39> Earlier that morning, the House of
Representatives was dissolved by president George Vella <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Vella>, upon Abela's recommendation.^[39]

    Campaign[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

A billboard with the Ukrainian flag which was put over Labour Party
banners during the campaign. News regarding the Russian invasion of
Ukraine overshadowed the news of the electoral campaign in Malta.

The campaign began on 21 February, and it lasted until 24 March, while
the election silence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_silence>
occurred on 25 March.^[50] <#cite_note-51> ^[51] <#cite_note-52> During
the first week of the campaign, Nationalist Party politicians Claudio
Grech, Kirsty Debono, and Clyde Puli, decided not to run, including
Rachael Scicluna, a Labour politician.^[52] <#cite_note-53> ^[53]
<#cite_note-54> /The Journal/ noted that the campaign was the "quietest
ever", due to "uninspiring proposals" and external events that
overshadowed the electoral campaign.^[54] <#cite_note-55> According to
journalist Julian Bonnici, it was also noted that events that caused the
2019 political crisis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2019_Malta_political_crisis> and 2019–2020 protests <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Maltese_protests>, had
"exhausted the voters".^[55] <#cite_note-56> Moreover, the outcome was
seemed to be already given, with polls indicating another Labour Party
victory, but also with the Russian invasion of Ukraine <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine> overshadowing
the electoral campaign events.^[56] <#cite_note-57> ^[57]
<#cite_note-58> ^[58] <#cite_note-59> Although, the campaign was also
termed to be free of major scandals that would influence the outcome of
the vote.^[59] <#cite_note-60> It was also noted that the Labour Party
has spent more money on campaign than the Nationalist Party.^[60]

"Malta Together", a slogan used by the Labour Party during the campaign
period

The Labour Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Malta)>
began its campaign in late February, during which the party stated its
pledge to convert Floriana <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floriana>'s St
Anne Street into a public garden.^[73] <#cite_note-74> In mid-March, the

    Aftermath[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2022_Maltese_general_election&action=edit&section=20>]

Labour Party officials claimed victory shortly after 09:00, with a
margin of more than 30,000 votes.^[114] <#cite_note-115> ^[115]
<#cite_note-116> Robert Abela was sworn in on 28 March,^[116]
<#cite_note-117> and a new government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Maltese_Government_2022%E2%80%932027> was formed on 30 March 2022.^[117]
<#cite_note-118> Bernard Grech <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bernard_Grech>, the leader of the Nationalist Party, conceded defeat,
and stated that he would contest the Nationalist Party leadership
election.^[118] <#cite_note-119> ^[119] <#cite_note-grech-120> He
denounced the incumbent government's tax relief cheques, sent the week
before the election, as ploys to influence the election.^[119]
<#cite_note-grech-120> Grech submitted his nomination on 13 May, with no
other member of the party challenging Grech for the role. The leadership
election was on 27 and 28 May.^[120] <#cite_note-121> Grech won 81% of
the vote in the leadership election.^[121] <#cite_note-122>

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-
operation_in_Europe> (OSCE) noted that the election was organised
"efficiently", although it noted that "its transparency was diminished
by limited access to Electoral Commission activities, the lack of
regulations allowing for election observation and limited oversight of
and access to information on party and campaign financing".^[122]
