Early parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria> on 2 October 2022 to elect members of
the 48th <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
48th_National_Assembly_of_Bulgaria> National Assembly <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(Bulgaria)>. The snap election
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election> was called after the fall
of the Petkov Government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Petkov_Government>, a four-party coalition, in June 2022. This was the
fourth parliamentary election since 2021, an unprecedented situation in
Bulgarian history, the previous elections being the April <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2021_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election>, July
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
July_2021_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election>, and November <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Bulgarian_general_election> 2021 elections.

As in the previous snap elections, no party secured a majority. The
GERB–SDS alliance emerged as the largest bloc with 67 seats and was
assigned the task of forming a government by President Rumen Radev
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumen_Radev>, but their efforts failed.
Radev then granted the We Continue the Change <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/We_Continue_the_Change> party and later the BSP for Bulgaria
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSP_for_Bulgaria> coalition a mandate to
form a government, but both were unsuccessful. As a result, Radev
scheduled another parliamentary election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2023_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election>, the fifth in two years, to take
place on 2 April 2023.

Turnout was at 39%, the lowest since 1990.^[1] <#cite_note-1>


    Background[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=2022_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=1>]

The 2021 Bulgarian general election <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2021_Bulgarian_general_election> in November saw We Continue the Change
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Continue_the_Change> (PP) achieve a
surprise victory,^[2] <#cite_note-2> receiving 25% of the vote. Led by
Kiril Petkov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiril_Petkov> and Asen
Vasilev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asen_Vasilev>, the PP formed a
coalition government <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petkov_Government>
with BSP for Bulgaria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSP_for_Bulgaria>
(BSPzB), There Is Such a People <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
There_Is_Such_a_People> (ITN) and Democratic Bulgaria <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Bulgaria> (DB). This broke the deadlock
that had arisen as a result of the previous two parliamentary elections,
after which no party was able to form a government.^[3] <#cite_note-3>

On 8 June 2022, ITN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
There_Is_Such_a_People> withdrew from the government <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
There_Is_Such_a_People#Withdrawal_from_government_and_split>, citing
disagreements over the state budget, fiscal policy and the lifting of
Bulgaria's veto on opening EU accession talks with North Macedonia. On
22 June, the government was defeated in a no confidence vote <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence> tabled by GERB <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GERB> and supported by DPS <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms>, ITN and Revival
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_(Bulgarian_political_party)>.

    Aftermath and coalition formation[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
    index.php?
    title=2022_Bulgarian_parliamentary_election&action=edit&section=9>]

As per the Bulgarian Constitution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Constitution_of_Bulgaria>, the Bulgarian President <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bulgaria> Rumen Radev <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumen_Radev> is required to hand a mandate for
government formation to the largest party. If they don't propose a
government within seven days, or if that government is rejected by the
Bulgarian Parliament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
National_Assembly_(Bulgaria)>, President Radev will hand the second
mandate to the second largest party. If the second mandate also doesn't
produce a government, the president will grant a third mandate to a
party of his choice. If no government is approved by Parliament after
all three mandates have been returned, new elections will be scheduled.
Neither GERB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GERB> nor PP <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Continue_the_Change>, the first and second
largest party respectively, are expected to be able to form a stable
government.^[8] <#cite_note-8>

Following the election, GERB leader Boyko Borisov <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyko_Borisov>, who had served as prime minister
for most of the time between 2009 and 2021, announced that he was not
interested in a cabinet position or returning to the post of prime
minister, stating that "now is not the right time for dominance, but for
seeking unity." Borisov's previous government had been the subject of
the 2020–2021 Bulgarian protests <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2020%E2%80%932021_Bulgarian_protests> over corruption allegations,^[9]
<#cite_note-9> the effects of which had been felt through all of the
legislative snap elections held since that point. He stated that GERB
was open to coalition talks with any party or coalition in the
legislature, even ones that had generally opposed him and GERB, and
sought party experts to seek common ground on main issues, including the
ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine>, the 2021–2022 inflation surge <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_inflation_surge>, joining the
eurozone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone>, and becoming part of
the Schengen Area <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area>.^[10]
<#cite_note-10>

The National Assembly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
National_Assembly_(Bulgaria)> remained fragmented, and no party was able
to form a governing coalition.^[11] <#cite_note-:1-11> GERB <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GERB> and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms> (DPS)
did not have a majority, holding only 103 of the 121 seats needed.
Bulgarian Rise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Rise> (BV) and
Revival <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Revival_(Bulgarian_political_party)>, which held a combined 39 seats,
are considered Eurosceptic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosceptic>
and sympathetic to Russia,^[12] <#cite_note-12> similarly to the
Bulgarian Socialist Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bulgarian_Socialist_Party> (BSP) with 25 seats. Although generally pro-
EU <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-EU>, the remaining parties and
alliances with seats opposed Boyko Borisov <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Boyko_Borisov>'s past government and refused any possibility of a
coalition with GERB due to disagreements over corruption.^[13]
<#cite_note-13>

On 18 October, Borisov announced that his attempts to broker a coalition
government prior to the first sitting of the new Assembly were
unsuccessful.^[14] <#cite_note-14> The following day, the Assembly
failed to elect a speaker during its first meeting, the first time this
ever occurred. After multiple failed attempts, the Assembly elected its
oldest member, the GERB MP Vezhdi Rashidov <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Vezhdi_Rashidov>, as speaker on 21 October, after he was nominated
by Korneliya Ninova <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korneliya_Ninova>,
the leader of BSP, as a consensus candidate.^[15] <#cite_note-15> ^[16]
<#cite_note-16> The gridlock to form a new government persisted
throughout October and November 2022 and before a first or second
mandate was given, President Rumen Radev <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Rumen_Radev> stated that he would delay handing over the third mandate
for government formation until after the New Year <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year> so as to delay elections until March
2023 and avoid the most difficult winter period.^[17] <#cite_note-17>

On 2 December, Radev stated that he would hand the government mandate to
the election's winner GERB the following Monday. On 5 December, Radev
granted the first mandate to GERB's nominee, Nikolay Gabrovski. One week
later, on 12 December, Gabrovski proposed a new government.^[18]
<#cite_note-18> His prime ministership was rejected by Parliament (113 /
for/, 125 /against/, 2 /absent/) two days later on 14 December, with MPs
from the DPS and BV voting in favour alongside GERB.^[19]
<#cite_note-19> On January 3, Radev gave the second mandate to PP's
candidate, Nikolai Denkov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nikolai_Denkov>,^[20] <#cite_note-20> but his prime ministership was
also rejected by Parliament (63 /for/, 84 /against/, 30 /abstain/, 63 /
absent/).^[21] <#cite_note-21> Radev gave the third mandate to Ninova,
although she rejected to form a government in a deadlocked
parliament.^[22] <#cite_note-:0-22> Observers already pointed at an
unprecedented fourth snap election to be held in 2023, as no new
government could be formed.^[23] <#cite_note-23> ^[24] <#cite_note-24>
