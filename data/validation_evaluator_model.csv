Independent Presidential elections were held in Egypt  in December 2023, as announced by the National Election

elections might be held earlier than expected. 
Candidate registration was from 5–14 October 2023 and the election was
held in Egypt from 10 to 12 December; 
expatriates voted from 1–3 December. Incumbent President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , who initially came to power in the aftermath of

term limits were adjusted from four to six years by a constitutional
amendment in 2019 , and he technically will not
have served as president for more than the maximum of 12 years at the
time of the election. His rule has been described as authoritarian
. 
        
 On 18 December he was reported to have won with 89.6% of
the vote. The voter turnout was stated to be 66.8% of registered
voters.  El-Sisi is set to be inaugurated for
another term by April 2024 at the latest.",How long was Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's presidential term adjusted to after the constitutional amendment in 2019?,"After the constitutional amendment in 2019, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's presidential term was adjusted to six years.",Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's presidential term was adjusted to six years after the constitutional amendment in 2019.

attacked Van der Bellen and the Austrian ÖVP-Green government repeatedly

to dismiss the current Austrian government immediately, install a new

(second round) of the opposition primary , becoming the United Opposition

majoritarian representation  with two methods; 106 are elected in
single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting , with the remaining 93
elected from a single nationwide constituency mostly by proportional
representation , via a partially compensatory system
 (a hybrid of parallel voting
 and mixed single vote
). The electoral
threshold is set at 5%, although this is raised to 10% for coalitions of
two parties and 15% for coalitions of three or more parties. Seats are
allocated using the d'Hondt method . The governing party is allowed to draw the boundaries of the single-
member constituencies, and the boundaries were gerrymandered by the
Fidesz government prior to the 2014 elections. The redrawing was done in
a way that smaller constituencies (with fewer than 70,000 voters) had
higher concentrations of Fidesz voters than larger constituencies (over
80,000 voters), meaning fewer votes were required to elect Fidesz
constituency candidates.  In 2010 seats varied in

to take place within the final 30 days of the current term of Parliament

The vote ought to be held on a non-working day – a Sunday or a public
holiday . Other
possible dates included 22 October 29 October, 1 November , 5 November and 11

representation  via the D'Hondt method  in multi-seat constituencies
,  with a 5% threshold for single party (KW) and
citizen committees (KWW) and an 8% threshold for coalitions (KKW).
National minority committees, such as the German minority , can apply to be exempt
from the nation-wide threshold, and in such case participate in the
d'Hondt seat distribution within their constituency, in this specific

This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of
two major court rulings that affected access to abortion . The first is the 2022 /Dobbs v. Jackson
Women's Health Organization / decision, in which the
United States Supreme Court overturned /Roe v. Wade /, leaving abortion law entirely to
the states, including bans on abortion. 
The second is the 2023 /Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food
and Drug Administration /, in which a federal judge in northwest Texas overturned the FDA 's approval of mifepristone  in 2000, which could potentially pull the medication from the market if upheld by higher courts.  Both rulings have received strong support from Republican  politicians and lawmakers.   Democrats  are predominantly supportive of
viewing abortion access as a right   while Republican
politicians generally favor significantly restricting the legality of
abortion .  By
April 2023, a large majority of Republican -controlled states had passed
near-total bans on abortion ,
rendering it ""largely illegal"" throughout much of the United States
